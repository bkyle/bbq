bbq
Persistent queueing system for Unix influenced by Git and Maildir
Bryan Kyle <bryan.kyle@gmail.com>

Overview
========

BBQ is a queueing system for Unix designed using the principles behind both Git and Maildir.


What's Missing:

- A way to dequeue messages (an agent) and supporting configuration.
- Lots of testing.

How BBQ Works
=============

- .bbq directory contains queued messages
- .bbq/tmp contains messages that are being enqueued.
- .bbq/cur contains messages that have been successfully queued and are ready for dequeuing.
- .bbq/clm contains messages that have been claimed for processing

- config file contains configuration for how messages are dequeued what what program to run?
- programs and support are contained within the root of the queue directory?
- should there be a bin directory with symlinks to bbq programs to start the agent?



Layout of a BBQ directory
=========================


Getting Started
===============

Creating a queue: 
$ mkdir myqueue
$ cd myqueue
$ bbq init

Enqueueing a message:
$ bbq enqueue path/to/myqueue
type your message here
